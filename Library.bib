  abstract = {Per-pixel classification algorithms are poorly equipped to monitor urban land use i n images acquired by the current generation of high spatial resolution satellite sensors. This is because urban areas commonly comprise a complex spatial assemblage of spectrally distinct land-cover types. In this study, a technique is described that attempts to derive information on urban land use in two stages. The first involves classification of the image into broad land-cover types. In the second stage, referred to as spatial reclassification, the classified pixels are grouped into discrete land-use categories on the basis of both the frequency and the spatial arrangement of the land-cover labels within a square kernel. The application of this technique, known as SPARK ( \textasciitilde{} \textasciitilde{} \textasciitilde{} Rt eicalaslsification erne el), is demonstrated using a SPOT-1 HRV m ultispectral image of southeast London, England. Preliminary results indicate that SPARK can be used to distinguish quite subtle differences of land use in urban areas.},

Unfortunately, shadows cast by buildings in high-density urban environments obscure much of the information in the image leading to potentially corrupted classification results or blunders in interpretation. Although significant research has been carried out on the subject of shadowing in remote sensing, very few studies have focused on the particular problems associated with high-resolution satellite imaging of urban areas. This paper reviews past and current research and proposes a solution to the problem of automatic detection and removal of shadow features. Tests show that although detection and removal of shadow features can lead to improved image quality, results can be image-dependent.},

  abstract = {Estimating urban green volume is getting more and more important within the frame of an ecologically orientated city planning and environmentally sustainable development. The first and the last pulse of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data provide the basis for the estimation of green volume, but these optimal data are not always available, particularly for urban areas. That is why this paper deals with the question whether LiDAR data (last pulse only) that have not been taken during the vegetation period allow a sufficient estimation of the green volume. This paper sets up on previous results where LiDAR data have been compared to photogrammetrically determined vegetation height measurements. The subtraction of the laser-based Digital Terrain Model and Digital Surface Model in vegetated areas leads to a vast underestimation of green volume of up to 85\%, which is mainly due to the standing deciduous trees with an underestimation of 90\%. Starting from the existence of different laser response characteristics of various vegetation types, the relative point density and the normalized height of classified nonground points were analyzed in depth. The results show a good separation of different vegetation types. Furthermore, a pragmatic approach of reconstruction of the underestimated vegetation (mainly deciduous trees) is carried out by generating cylinders for the classified nonground points to compensate the volume loss. The point density of nonground points and the normalized height of the laser responses were used to regulate the adaptive cylinder construction based on fuzzy logic techniques. Using reference data, the accuracy could be estimated. In spite of the suboptimal LiDAR data, this paper leads to a sufficiently exact and efficient estimation of green volume compared to the costly conventional methods like field investigations. The method makes a contribution in the field of data improvement and is applicable to similar LiDAR data of other areas.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the potential applications of satellite remote sensing to regional science research in urban settings. Regional science is the study of social problems that have a spatial dimension. The availability of satellite remote sensing data has increased significantly in the last two decades, and these data constitute a useful data source for mapping the composition of urban settings and analyzing changes over time. The increasing spatial resolution of commercial satellite imagery has influenced the emergence of new research and applications of regional science in urban settlements because it is now possible to identify individual objects of the urban fabric. The most common applications found in the literature are the detection of urban deprivation hot spots, quality of life index assessment, urban growth analysis, house value estimation, urban population estimation and urban social vulnerability assessment. The satellite remote sensing imagery used in these applications has medium, high or very high spatial resolution, such as images from Landsat MSS, Landsat TM and ETM+, SPOT, ASTER, IRS, Ikonos and QuickBird. Consistent relationships between socio-economic variables derived from censuses and field surveys and proxy variables of vegetation coverage measured from satellite remote sensing data have been found in several cities in the US. Different approaches and techniques have been applied successfully around the world, but local research is always needed to account for the unique elements of each place. Spectral mixture analysis, object-oriented classifications and image texture measures are some of the techniques of image processing that have been implemented with good results. Many regional scientists remain skeptical that satellite remote sensing will produce useful information for their work. More local research is needed to demonstrate the real potential and utility of satellite remote sensing for regional science in urban environments.},

The representation of both the ground surface and the features on that surface necessitates the removal of these surface features if a ground surface Digital Elevation Model (DEM) product is to be produced. This paper examines methods for extracting surface features from a Digital Surface Model (DSM) produced by LiDAR. It is argued that for some applications the extracted surface feature layer can be of almost equal importance to the DEM. The example of flood inundation modelling is used to illustrate how a DEM and a surface roughness layer could be extracted from the original DSM. The potential for refining surface roughness estimates by classifying extracted surface features using both topographic and spectral characteristics is considered using an Artificial Neural Network to discriminate between buildings and trees.},

  abstract = {Inundation disasters, caused by sudden water level rise or rapid flow, occur frequently in various parts of the world. Such catastrophes strike not only in thinly populated flood plains or farmland but also in highly populated villages or urban areas. Inundation of the populated areas causes severe damage to the economy, injury, and loss of life; therefore, a proper management scheme for the disaster has to be developed. To predict and manage such adversity, an understanding of the dynamic processes of inundation flow is necessary because risk estimation is performed based on inundation flow information. In this study, we developed a comprehensive method to conduct detailed inundation flow simulations for a populated area with quite complex topographical features using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. Detailed geospatial information including the location and shape of each building was extracted from the LiDAR data and used for the grid generation. The developed approach can distinguish buildings from vegetation and treat them differently in the flow model. With this method, a fine unstructured grid can be generated representing the complicated urban land features precisely without exhausting labour for data preparation. The accuracy of the generated grid with different grid spacing and grid type is discussed and the optimal range of grid spacing for direct representation of urban topography is investigated. The developed method is applied to the estimation of inundation flows, which occurred in the basin of the Shin-minato River. A detailed inundation flow structure is represented by the flow model, and the flow characteristics with respect to topographic features are discussed.

  abstract = {Distribution of land cover has a profound impact on the climate and environment; mapping the land cover patterns from global, regional to local scales are important for scientists and authorities to yield better monitoring of the changing world. Satellite remote sensing has been demonstrated as an efficient tool to monitor the land cover patterns for a large spatial extent. Nevertheless, the demand on land cover maps at a finer scale (especially in urban areas) has been raised with evidence by numerous biophysical and socio-economic studies. This paper reviews the small-footprint LiDAR sensor \textemdash{} one of the latest high resolution airborne remote sensing technologies, and its application on urban land cover classification. While most of the early researches focus on the analysis of geometric components of 3D LiDAR data point clouds, there has been an increasing interest in investigating the use of intensity data, waveform data and multi-sensor data to facilitate land cover classification and object recognition in urban environment. In this paper, the advancement of airborne LiDAR technology, including data configuration, feature spaces, classification techniques, and radiometric calibration/correction is reviewed and discussed. The review mainly focuses on the LiDAR studies conducted during the last decade with an emphasis on identification of the approach, analysis of pros and cons, investigating the overall accuracy of the technology, and how the classification results can serve as an input for different urban environmental analyses. Finally, several promising directions for future LiDAR research are highlighted, in hope that it will pave the way for the applications of urban environmental modeling and assessment at a finer scale and a greater extent.},

Given the limited user input, the system automatically segments the building boundary, does the model refinement, and assembles the complete building model. By adapting a set of appropriate geometric primitives and fitting strategies, the system can model a range of complex buildings with irregular shapes. We demonstrate this system's ability to model a variety of complex buildings rapidly and accurately from LiDAR data of the entire USC campus.},

An object-based method is proposed to process the LiDAR data for the building density information. The method consists of a sequence of numerical operations: generating the normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM), extracting building objects, deriving object attributes, associating objects with the corresponding land lots, and computing building density indicators at land lot and urban district scales. The algorithms for these operations have been implemented as an ArcGIS extension module. The object-based method is applied to the processing of airborne LiDAR data over downtown Houston. Various attributes have been derived to quantify the building density, urban physical structure, and landscape morphological characteristics of the downtown area at three different spatial scales.},

  abstract = {The surface urban heat island (SUHI), which represents the difference of land surface temperature (LST) in urban relativity to neighboring non-urban surfaces, is usually measured using satellite LST data. Over the last few decades, advancements of remote sensing along with spatial science have considerably increased the number and quality of SUHI studies that form the major body of the urban heat island (UHI) literature. This paper provides a systematic review of satellite-based SUHI studies, from their origin in 1972 to the present. We find an exponentially increasing trend of SUHI research since 2005, with clear preferences for geographic areas, time of day, seasons, research foci, and platforms/sensors. The most frequently studied region and time period of research are China and summer daytime, respectively. Nearly two-thirds of the studies focus on the SUHI/LST variability at a local scale. The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are the two most commonly-used satellite sensors and account for about 78\% of the total publications. We systematically reviewed the main satellite/sensors, methods, key findings, and challenges of the SUHI research. Previous studies confirm that the large spatial (local to global scales) and temporal (diurnal, seasonal, and inter-annual) variations of SUHI are contributed by a variety of factors such as impervious surface area, vegetation cover, landscape structure, albedo, and climate. However, applications of SUHI research are largely impeded by a series of data and methodological limitations. Lastly, we propose key potential directions and opportunities for future efforts. Besides improving the quality and quantity of LST data, more attention should be focused on understudied regions/cities, methods to examine SUHI intensity, inter-annual variability and long-term trends of SUHI, scaling issues of SUHI, the relationship between surface and subsurface UHIs, and the integration of remote sensing with field observations and numeric modeling.},
