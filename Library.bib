  abstract = {Lidar (, also LIDAR, or LiDAR; sometimes LADAR) is an acronym of "light detection and ranging" or "laser imaging, detection, and ranging". It is a method for determining ranges by targeting an object or a surface with a laser and measuring the time for the reflected light to return to the receiver. It is sometimes called 3-D laser scanning, a special combination of 3-D scanning and laser scanning. LIDAR has terrestrial, airborne, and mobile applications.Lidar is commonly used to make high-resolution maps, with applications in surveying, geodesy, geomatics, archaeology, geography, geology, geomorphology, seismology, forestry, atmospheric physics, laser guidance, airborne laser swath mapping (ALSM), and laser altimetry. It is used to make digital 3-D representations of areas on the Earth's surface and ocean bottom of the intertidal and near coastal zone by varying the wavelength of light. It has also been increasingly used in control and navigation for autonomous cars and for the helicopter Ingenuity on its record-setting flights over the terrain of Mars.},

It looks at the strategies that have been enacted, both visible or overt and invisible or covert, opening up the tricky question of what counts (and what does not) as resistance to gentrification. In so doing it highlights the much less considered value of invisible practices of resistance: the non-politicised, covert, unintentional, informal, and deliberately invisible practices of everyday life that draw on different perceptions of time and survival, the negotiation of ambiguity and mobilization of invisibility. The chapter discusses what resistance is and what we might mean by resistance specifically in the field of gentrification studies. Is anti-gentrification resistance about the creation of alternatives or simply a series of oppositional, defensive practices? How can we evaluate if resistance has been successful? The chapter concludes that the visibility of resistance and counter collective knowledge production central in anti-gentrification practices might not be that useful after all in spaces where informality, ambiguity and invisibility have become some of the best strategies through which to resist the assault of displacement.},

To date, direct evidence on the scale or impact of these flows has been weak since they are difficult to assess using survey methods. Using 2001 census data for England and Scotland, this paper looks at the scale and composition of flows for deprived neighbourhoods with a particular focus on educational attainment. It analyses the impacts of these flows on the characteristics of deprived areas, exploring differences between regions and comparing neighbourhoods involved in two major regeneration programmes with other deprived areas. The paper shows that selective migration flows do serve to reinforce spatial segregation but that the scale of this effect appears very modest and that impacts vary between regions. Flows for the regeneration areas are less adverse than for similarly deprived neighbourhoods.},

This is because urban areas commonly comprise a complex spatial assemblage of spectrally distinct land-cover types. In this study, a technique is described that attempts to derive information on urban land use in two stages. The first involves classification of the image into broad land-cover types. In the second stage, referred to as spatial reclassification, the classified pixels are grouped into discrete land-use categories on the basis of both the frequency and the spatial arrangement of the land-cover labels within a square kernel. The application of this technique, known as SPARK ( \textasciitilde{} \textasciitilde{} \textasciitilde{} Rt eicalaslsification erne el), is demonstrated using a SPOT-1 HRV m ultispectral image of southeast London, England. Preliminary results indicate that SPARK can be used to distinguish quite subtle differences of land use in urban areas.},

Social gradients in health are measured using deprivation indices, which are typically constructed from aggregated socio-economic data taken from the national census \textendash{} a technique which dates back at least until the early 1970's. The primary method of index construction over the last decade has been a Principal Component Analysis. Seldom are the indices constructed from survey-based data sources due to the inherent difficulty in validating the subjectivity of the response scores. We argue that this very subjectivity can uncover spatial distributions of local health outcomes. Moreover, indication of neighbourhood socio-economic status may go underrepresented when weighted without expert opinion. In this paper we propose the use of geographic information science (GIS) for constructing the index. We employ a GIS-based Order Weighted Average (OWA) Multicriteria Analysis (MCA) as a technique to validate deprivation indices that are constructed using more qualitative data sources. Both OWA and traditional MCA are well known and used methodologies in spatial analysis but have had little application in social epidemiology.},

The ability of agent-based models (ABMs) to represent heterogeneity in the characteristics and behaviors of actors enables analyses about the implications of this heterogeneity for system behavior. The importance of heterogeneity in the specification of ABMs, however, creates new demands for empirical support. An earlier analysis of a survey of residential preferences within southeastern Michigan revealed seven groups of residents with similar preferences on similar characteristics of location. In this paper, we present an ABM that represents the process of residential development within an urban system and run it for a hypothetical pattern of environmental variation. Residential locations are selected by residential agents, who evaluate locations on the basis of preference for nearness to urban services, including jobs, aesthetic quality of the landscape, and their similarity to their neighbors. We populate our ABM with a population of residential preferences drawn from the survey results in five different ways: (1) preferences drawn at random; (2) equal preferences based on the mean from the entire survey sample; (3) preferences drawn from a single distribution, whose mean and standard deviation are derived from the survey sample; (4) equal preferences within each of seven groups, based on the group means; and (5) preferences drawn from distributions for each of seven groups, defined by group means and standard deviations. Model sensitivity analysis, based on multiple runs of our model under each case, revealed that adding heterogeneity to agents has a significant effect on model outcomes, measured by aggregate patterns of development sprawl and clustering.},

This paper adopts an integrated spatial regression approach to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of these factors' effects on population change. Specifically, we conduct the analysis at the minor civil division level in Wisconsin, USA, from 1970 to 2000. The results suggest that the factors have varying effects on population change over time and across rural, suburban, and urban areas. Their effects depend upon the general trend of population redistribution processes, local dynamics, and areal characteristics. Overall, a systematic examination of population change should consider a variety of factors, temporal and spatial variation of their effects, and spatial spillover effects. The examination should have the flexibility to identify and incorporate influential factors at a given point in time and space, not to adhere to a single set of drivers in all circumstances. The findings have important implications for population predictions used for local and regional planning.},

  abstract = {Several methods for the analysis of remotely sensed reflectance data are compared, including empirical methods and scattering theories, both of which are important for solving remote sensing problems. The concept of the photon mean optical path length and the implications for use in modeling reflectance spectra are presented. It is shown that the mean optical path length in a particulate surface is in rough inverse proportion to the square root of the absorption coefficient. Thus, the stronger absorber a material is, the less photons will penetrate into the surface. The concept of apparent absorbance (-In reflectance) is presented, and it is shown that absorption bands, which are Gaussian in shape when plotted as absorption coefficient (true absorbance) versus photon energy, are also Gaussians in apparent absorbance. However, the Gaussians in apparent absorbance have a smaller intensity and a width which is a factor of {$\surd$}2 larger. An apparent continuum in a reflectance spectrum is modeled as a mathematical function used to isolate a particular absorption feature for analysis. It is shown that a continuum should be removed by dividing it into the reflectance spectrum or subtracting it from the apparent absorbance and that the fitting of Gaussians to absorption features should be done using apparent absorbance versus photon energy. Kubelka-Munk theory is only valid for materials with small total absorption and for bihemispherical reflectance, which are rarely encountered in geologic remote sensing. It is shown that the recently advocated bidirectional reflectance theories have the potential for use in deriving mineral abundance from a reflectance spectrum.},

Because the issues of racial composition are socially sensitive, additional tests examined the relationship of preferences to behavior. Although many behaviors generally follow expressed preferences, members of households who expressed ``no preference'' also were found to largely choose own race neighborhoods. The results of this study suggest that the expressed preference for own race/own ethnicity, in combination with short-distance local moves, is likely to maintain present patterns of separation in U.S. metropolitan areas.},

Yet social and mobile datasets have limitations that, if not sufficiently understood and accounted for, can produce specific kinds of analytical and ethical oversights. In this paper, we analyze some of the problems that emerge from the reliance on particular forms of crisis data, and we suggest ways forward through a deeper engagement with ethical frameworks and a more critical questioning of what crisis data actually represents. In particular, the use of Twitter data and crowdsourced text messages during crisis events such as Hurricane Sandy and the Haiti Earthquake raised questions about the ways in which crisis data act as a system of knowledge. We analyze these events from ontological, epistemological, and ethical perspectives and assess the challenges of data collection, analysis and deployment. While privacy concerns are often dismissed when data is scraped from public-facing platforms such as Twitter, we suggest that the kinds of personal information shared during a crisis\textemdash often as a way to find assistance and support\textemdash present ongoing risks. We argue for a deeper integration of critical data studies into crisis research, and for researchers to acknowledge their role in shaping norms of privacy and consent in data use.},

Although significant research has been carried out on the subject of shadowing in remote sensing, very few studies have focused on the particular problems associated with high-resolution satellite imaging of urban areas. This paper reviews past and current research and proposes a solution to the problem of automatic detection and removal of shadow features. Tests show that although detection and removal of shadow features can lead to improved image quality, results can be image-dependent.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the so-called sharing economy has spread all over the world and, through the proliferation of online peer-to-peer platforms, provides a marketplace that matches sellers who want to sell/share their underutilised assets with buyers who need them. One of the well-known and heavily debated manifestations of the sharing economyis an accommodation provider platform called Airbnb. Airbnb is experiencing astonishing growth provoking several intense debates, regulatory challenges, and political battles due to its wide-spread effects on rental and real-estate markets. Thus, it is important to analyse the uneven spatial effects of the phenomenon. This paper aims to map Airbnb's presence in New York City but, going beyond visual inspection, it analyses the socio-economic factors influencing the spatiality of Airbnb in the American metropolis. After collecting data from various data sources, we performed a statistical analysis (correlation, regression analysis) to determine the socio-economic conditions of areas and revealed those factors that may affect the spatial distribution of Airbnb listings in the city. Results highlight that (1) Airbnb supply concentrates in those parts of New York City with a young population, (2) there is a significant number of housing units, and (3) the number of points of interest is high.},

One essential component of healthy city design is improving neighborhood conditions in previously disinvested areas. To ensure equitable city design, policy makers, city planners, health practitioners, and researchers are interested in understanding the complex relationship between urban change, gentrification, and population health. Yet, the causal link between gentrification and health outcomes remain unclear. Without clear and consistent gentrification measures, researchers struggle to identify populations who are exposed to gentrification, and to compare health outcomes between exposed and unexposed populations. To move the science forward, this paper summarizes the challenges related to gentrification measurement in the United States and Canada when aspiring to conduct studies to analyze causal relationships between gentrification and health. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations for studies aimed at examining both causes and consequences of gentrification and health.},

Although persons wishing to live near large cities were found to be looking for the same qualities of living sought by those who prefer a more remote location, these findings are not, in general, consistent with the argument that public preferences support strategies of population dispersal into nonmetropolitan areas. Instead they indicate that most of those who wish to live in a different location favor the peripheral metropolitan ring areas that have, in fact, been growing rapidly by in-migration.},

However, there is a dearth of longitudinal evidence of the mechanisms and impact of blue spaces on clinical markers of mental health to support and inform such interventions. We conducted a 10-year retrospective study, following STROBE guidelines, using routinely collected population primary care health data within the National Health Service (NHS) administrative area of Greater Glasgow and Clyde for the North of Glasgow city area. We explored whether living near blue space modifies the negative effect of socio-economic deprivation on mental health during the regeneration of an urban blue space (canal) from complete dereliction and closure. A total of 132,788 people (65,351 female) fulfilling the inclusion criteria were entered in the analysis. We established a base model estimating the effect of deprivation on the risk of mental health disorders using a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for age, sex and pre-existing comorbidities. We then investigated the modifying effect of living near blue space by computing a second model which included distance to blue space as an additional predicting variable and compared the results to the base model. Living near blue space modified the risk of mental health disorders deriving from socio-economic deprivation by 6\% (hazard ratio 2.48, 95\% confidence interval 2.39\textendash 2.57) for those living in the most deprived tertile (T1) and by 4\% (hazard ratio 1.66, 95\% confidence interval 1.60\textendash 1.72) for those in the medium deprivation tertile (T2). Our findings support the notion that living near blue space could play an important role in reducing the burden of mental health inequalities in urban populations.},

  abstract = {The importance of neighbourhood on individual health is widely documented. Less is known about the relative role of objective and subjective reports of neighbourhood conditions, how their effect on health changes as people age, and whether they moderate each other's impact on health. This study uses the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) to determine whether older adults report worse self-rated health as they age, and whether this differs between objective and subjective measures of neighbourhood. ELSA data contain 53,988 person-years across six waves collected biannually between 2002 and 03 and 2012~and 13. Objective neighbourhood conditions are measured by the 2004 Index of Multiple Deprivation, and subjective neighbourhood conditions are captured by a summative neighbourhood dissatisfaction score. We find both objective and subjective neighbourhood composite scores independently predict poor health. There is no change over time in the probability of reporting poor health by baseline objective or subjective neighbourhood scores, suggesting neighbourhood effects do not compound as older adults age. There is no moderating effect of area dissatisfaction on the relationship between neighbourhood deprivation and health. The findings provide little support for causal neighbourhood effects operating in later life and indicate different causal pathways through which objective and subjective neighbourhood deprivation impact on health.},

This paper asks whether the ``Coase theorem'' for addressing the problem of externalities might provide insights for addressing such challenges in addition to, or instead of, traditional forms of planning control. Focusing specifically on the manifestation of Airbnb as the largest global platform for online home-sharing, the paper identifies the range of externalities and impacts associated with different home-sharing practices under different neighbourhood and housing market contexts. It then examines the potential utility of the Coase theorem which argues that well defined property rights provide a basis for private arbitration and compensation over externalities, without the need for government intervention, to help resolve impacts arising from Airbnb style home-sharing. In particular, the paper examines whether the low transaction cost enabled by online platforms, may support new forms of bargaining and compensation as alternatives to traditional planning regulation and control, and the extent to which arbitrated solutions could address the spectrum of externalities associated with Airbnb and similar platforms. Data sources include public submissions to a 2015 government inquiry on the regulation of short term holiday accommodation (in the state of NSW, Australia), as well as a comparative analysis of the geography and scale of Airbnb listings in two distinct metropolitan and regional areas of the state (Greater Sydney and the Northern Rivers region of coastal NSW). The paper concludes that a Coasian approach might inspire more pragmatic alternatives to traditional forms of urban regulation and control but fails to address the wider spatial policy and housing market concerns associated with Airbnb style holiday rentals.},

  abstract = {Since the late 1980s two waves of gentrification have occurred in Guangzhou, China and brought about dramatic transformations of cityscape and sociospatial configuration in the central city. Accordingly, the emphasis of urban policy has shifted from fighting the ?blight? to eliminating the ?obsolescence?, which signifies the rise of neoliberal urban policies. The first wave of gentrification started in the late 1980s and paused in 1999 and was mainly in the form of sporadic housing redevelopment justified by city betterment and infrastructure improvement. The second wave surged around 2005, featuring an ambitious urban upgrading scheme with the aim of building a world-class city. While the first wave of gentrification was a modest experiment of marketised operation, the second wave of gentrification is at the core of the local government's growth-seeking and city reimaging neoliberal urban strategy. Defending the right to appropriation has been a major struggle for residents affected in both waves of gentrification, although in the first wave there was very little room left for rights claiming. In the second wave, rights conflicts have gone deeper and been more fierce, and struggles for a right to participation started to rise. Buttressed by local media, academics, activists, and volunteers, local residents have made modest progress in defending their rights. Yet, it is still far from seriously challenging the power structure in urban decision-making and the trajectory of (re)urbanisation dominated by the elite class and vested interest groups.},

  abstract = {Estimating urban green volume is getting more and more important within the frame of an ecologically orientated city planning and environmentally sustainable development. The first and the last pulse of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data provide the basis for the estimation of green volume, but these optimal data are not always available, particularly for urban areas. That is why this paper deals with the question whether LiDAR data (last pulse only) that have not been taken during the vegetation period allow a sufficient estimation of the green volume. This paper sets up on previous results where LiDAR data have been compared to photogrammetrically determined vegetation height measurements. The subtraction of the laser-based Digital Terrain Model and Digital Surface Model in vegetated areas leads to a vast underestimation of green volume of up to 85\%, which is mainly due to the standing deciduous trees with an underestimation of 90\%. Starting from the existence of different laser response characteristics of various vegetation types, the relative point density and the normalized height of classified nonground points were analyzed in depth. The results show a good separation of different vegetation types. Furthermore, a pragmatic approach of reconstruction of the underestimated vegetation (mainly deciduous trees) is carried out by generating cylinders for the classified nonground points to compensate the volume loss. The point density of nonground points and the normalized height of the laser responses were used to regulate the adaptive cylinder construction based on fuzzy logic techniques. Using reference data, the accuracy could be estimated. In spite of the suboptimal LiDAR data, this paper leads to a sufficiently exact and efficient estimation of green volume compared to the costly conventional methods like field investigations. The method makes a contribution in the field of data improvement and is applicable to similar LiDAR data of other areas.},

These debates focus primarily on structural processes. However, we have comparatively little insight into how and to what degree different mechanisms actually underpin upgrading in urban neighbourhoods. This paper uses Dutch register data to show how residential mobility, social mobility, and demographic change each contribute to gentrification in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. First, our findings show that residential mobility remains key to understanding the growth of higher-income residents in gentrifiying neighbourhoods. At the same time, social mobility and demographic change? notably ageing?are most important in explaining dwindling numbers of lower-income residents. Second, large differences exist across neighbourhoods. By mapping three idealtypical drivers of gentrification, we show how the migration-based ?displacement model? occurs predominantly in upgrading neighbourhoods with a high status. Conversely, in low-status upgrading neighbourhoods social mobility is more important in explaining gentrification. These different forms of upgrading occur simultaneously in both cities and should be integrated to advance our understanding of gentrification as a process that is both widespread and occurs in different, ever-changing forms across neighbourhoods.},

Such systems along with spatial analysis techniques like digital image processing and geographical information system (GIS) can be used for the monitoring and planning purposes as these enable the reporting of overall sprawl at a detailed level. In the present work, urban sprawl of the Ajmer city (situated in Rajasthan State of India) has been studied at a mid scale level, over a period of 25 years (1977\textendash 2002), to extract the information related to sprawl, area of impervious surfaces and their spatial and temporal variability. Statistical classification approaches have been used for the classification of the remotely sensed images obtained from various sensors viz. Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+ and IRS LISS-III. Urban sprawl and its spatial and temporal characteristics have been derived from the classified satellite images. The Shannon's entropy and landscape metrics (patchiness and map density) have been computed in terms of spatial phenomenon, in order to quantify the urban form (impervious area). Further, multivariate statistical techniques have been used to establish the relationship between the urban sprawl and its causative factors. Results reveal that land development (160.8\%) in Ajmer is more than three times the population growth (50.1\%). Shannon's entropy and landscape metrics has revealed the spatial distribution of the urban sprawl over a period of last 25 years.},

Various aspects of remote sensing are routinely used to detect and map features and changes on land and sea surfaces, and in the atmosphere that affect urban sustainability. We provide a critical and comprehensive review of the characteristics of remote sensing systems, and in particular the trade-offs between various system parameters, as well as their use in two key research areas: (a) issues resulting from the expansion of urban environments, and (b) sustainable urban development. The analysis identifies three key trends in the existing literature: (a) the integration of heterogeneous remote sensing data, primarily for investigating or modelling urban environments as a complex system, (b) the development of new algorithms for effective extraction of urban features, and (c) the improvement in the accuracy of traditional spectral-based classification algorithms for addressing the spectral heterogeneity within urban areas. Growing interests in renewable energy have also resulted in the increased use of remote sensing\textemdash for planning, operation, and maintenance of energy infrastructures, in particular the ones with spatial variability, such as solar, wind, and geothermal energy. The proliferation of sustainability thinking in all facets of urban development and management also acts as a catalyst for the increased use of, and advances in, remote sensing for urban applications.},

The rapid, unplanned transformation of urban LULC significantly affects the functions of the associated ecosystem and biodiversity. This study aims to identify the variation in LULC, and its influences on the urban thermal environment, such as LST, urban heat island (UHI), and urban field variance index (UTFVI), for Chattogram city, Bangladesh. Multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper/OLI: Operational Land Imager (TM/OLI) satellite images were used for the years 1999, 2009, and 2019, to classify LULC classes, identify the transition between different LULCs and to quantify variation in LST, UHI and UFVI distribution in the study area. Using the support vector machine algorithm, the LULC was classified, and the accuracy of the categorized maps was more than 85\%. The spectral radiance model was used to extract urban thermal information from satellite images. The analysis of LULC estimation suggests a significant net increase in urban built-up areas (+3.51\%) and a reduction in vegetation cover (-6.81\%). The mean LST distribution shows that the high-temperature zones were associated with built-up areas, with the lowest temperatures being associated with vegetated cover and water bodies. The UHI and UTFVI estimation also indicate a trend toward increased surface heat stress in the study area. The study demonstrates that a rise in the non-evaporative surfaces (built-up area) and a reduction in the green cover has significantly increased the LST, UHI and UTFVI effects in the study area. Remote-sensing techniques were found to be very useful, particularly in minimizing the time required to evaluate urban expansion and to assess the influence of urbanization on LST.},

Novel analytical practices promise smoother decision-making as part of a more evidence-based and smarter urbanism, while critical voices highlight the dangers and pitfalls of instrumental, data-driven city making to urban governance. Less attention has been devoted to identifying the practical conditions under which big data can realistically contribute to addressing urban policy problems. In this paper, we discuss the value and limitations of big data for long-term urban policy and planning. We first develop a theoretical perspective on urban analytics as a practice that is part of a new smart urbanism. We identify the particular tension of opposed temporalities of high-frequency data and the long dur\'ee of structural challenges facing cities. Drawing on empirical studies using big urban data, we highlight epistemological and practical challenges that arise from the analysis of high-frequency data for strategic purposesand formulate propositions on the ways in which urban analytics can inform long-term urban policy.},

Socio-economic variables, including population density, income, poverty, employment rate, education level and house characteristics from US census 2000, were integrated with the environmental variables at the block group level to derive indicators of quality of life. Pearson's correlation was computed to analyse the relationships among the variables. Further, factor analysis was conducted to extract unique information from the combined dataset. Three factors were identified and interpreted as material welfare, environmental conditions and crowdedness respectively. Each factor was viewed as a unique aspect of the quality of life.

  abstract = {With the rural-to-urban migration under China's rapid urbanization, the Bohai Rim of China experienced dramatic rural housing land transition (RHLT) in the last decade, especially in terms of per capita rural housing land (PRHL). The objectives of this study are to (i) analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of RHLT, and (ii) detect the underlying driving forces and mechanism of RHLT in Bohai Rim during 2000\textendash 2010. To achieve these goals, we collected and rasterized high resolution Landsat TM data, socio-economic and physical environmental data for the Bohai Rim. Spatial econometric regression models at both grid scale and county scale were developed to examine the driving forces of RHLT in Bohai Rim. The results indicated that the distribution of rural housing land was characterized by vertical zonality, i.e., the proportion of rural housing land decreased gradually with the increase of elevation, and was more sensitive to slope than to elevation. The results of hot spots analysis showed that the spatial mismatch of rural housing land change and rural population migration made the regional differences of RHLT more remarkable, based on which four rural housing land consolidation regional types were differentiated. The authors argue that towns are effective hubs for linking the urban system and rural system, and it is better to get the farmers to migrate to towns instead of big cities in the process of pushing forward China's new-type urbanization in the future. For this, it is necessary to further improve related system and institution. Only by this way can the relationship between out-migrated farmers and rural housing land be orderly and completely removed, so as to smoothly pushing forward rural housing land consolidation.},

However, some scholars believe the declining rate of American internal migration seems to have `slowed down' obviously from 2007. This debate prompts us to quantitatively analyze the possible changes in migration patterns and the mechanisms of domestic population mobility. First, using empirical data of state-to-state migration, the paper quantifies American internal mobility and the evolution of migration patterns for the period from 2005\textendash 2015. Regional income disparities cannot explain the change in population migration patterns in the United States well. Then, the mobility barriers are estimated by an extended multilateral migration model that reveals a marked decrease in regional migration costs and an increase in individual rational choices, which are the critical factors in the structural changes in the migration pattern. Subsequently, we deconstruct the mobility barriers and indicate that in recent years, the human and natural environments had a great impact on population movement in the United States, such as the human development index, education grade, climate, cost of living index, house price index, and crime rate.},

  abstract = {Tourism gentrification is a consequence of both `gentrification generalized' and the rapid development of the global tourism industry. The geographical spread of tourism gentrification from Western countries to emerging countries like China inevitably challenges existing explanations. Using the case of the Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town (OCT) community in China, this study examines the causes and socio-spatial consequences of tourism gentrification with the aim of widening the discussion on tourism gentrification. Historically, the Shenzhen OCT community was a traditional farm with single group of peasants. Over the past two decades, it has become a mixed gentrified community with upper-class and low-income residents. Theme parks and other tourist facilities now dominate much of the community. This empirical analysis of this community highlights some of the features of tourism gentrification in China. It can be a type of new-build gentrification evolving from a brownfield area. The emergence of a rent gap is the result of rapid urbanization in China but not of suburbanization. The government gives the primary land developers some community administration rights to promote tourism and community development. Tourism gentrification leads to a mixed community with a certain proportion of low-income residents, which generates a diversity of cultural preferences and consumption patterns in the OCT community. In the changing context of China and other emerging countries, tourism gentrification is one part of a broader transformation of social space from lower-class to upper-class spaces. In this case, tourism becomes the main driving force in economic, social, cultural, and lifestyle transformations.},

This paper analyzes the trend and spatial differences of rural population change and the driving forces of this process. The main findings are summarized as follows. First, the total rural population decreased after 1995, and the size and rate of decrease follow an accelerating trend. Second, the rural population change has obvious spatial differences: some regions experience dramatic rural population decline, while others experience growth. Third, the spatial difference of rural population change is closely related to economic factors, including the per capita GDP, urbanization level, and noneconomic factors, including the rural population size and fertility level. According to our findings, we suggest that the government pay more attention to rural population change and its impacts and that narrowing the regional development gap may be the most effective way to promote sustainable development of rural areas in less developed regions.},

Rural population loss (RPL) is not only due to the laws of social and economic development but also the comprehensive action of natural, social, and economic factors. Taking 774 administrative villages in Laiyang County, which is in a hilly region, as our research area, we comprehensively used spatial analysis and geographic detectors to explore the spatial characteristics and driving factors of RPL, which was significantly correlated with rural planning. The research demonstrated that: (1) The rural population in Laiyang County generally had a low level of RPL (1.9\%), but each village varied greatly. The village with the greatest RPL had a rate of 56\%. The RPL between urban and rural areas, towns and streets, and villages and villages were unbalanced, and rural population flow mainly occurred between urban and rural areas. (2) RPL in Laiyang County was generally low in the central urban area and high in the northern and southern areas. Population loss presents agglomeration globally and high\textendash low agglomeration locally. (3) The distance from village to county, elevation, cultivated land quantity, collective economic income, village area, and ecological service value were the key factors influencing RPL in Laiyang County. When comparing the dominant factors, the interaction between collective income and elevation was the strongest. Exploring the spatial characteristics and influencing factors of RPL provided us with ideas for the classified promotion of rural revitalization, preparation of rural development planning, and promotion of the integrated development of urban and rural areas.},

  abstract = {Neighbourhood effects studies have demonstrated an association between area deprivation and smoking behaviour whereby people living in deprived neighbourhoods are more likely to smoke than those in non-deprived neighbourhoods. This evidence though is based largely upon data that ignores long term exposures to neighbourhood contexts and is confounded by neighbourhood selection bias. In this study, we investigate the temporal ordering of exposure to neighbourhood deprivation throughout childhood and whether associations between neighbourhood deprivation and cigarette smoking are due to compositional or contextual neighbourhood effects. Data come from a UK cohort study, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We use longitudinal measures of neighbourhood deprivation and self-reported smoking behaviour for 2744 children to examine the influence of neighbourhood deprivation on smoking status and smoking heaviness at age 17. Our results demonstrate that children who are born into and grow up in deprived neighbourhoods are up to twice as likely to be smokers at age 17 than those in non-deprived neighbourhoods. These associations are largely due to family socioeconomic position and the intergenerational transmission of smoking behaviour from parents to children; compositional rather than direct contextual `neighbourhood effects'. Our findings highlight the importance of considering longitudinal exposure to neighbourhood deprivation over cross sectional exposure. In conclusion, we find that it is the family rather than the neighbourhood into which a child is born that determines their smoking behaviour.},

To facilitate the monitoring of social inequalities for health planning, this study proposes a material and social deprivation index for Canada. After explaining the concept of deprivation, we describe the methodological aspects of the index and apply it to the example of premature mortality (i.e. death before the age of 75). We illustrate variations in deprivation and the links between deprivation and mortality nationwide and in different geographic areas including the census metropolitan areas (CMAs) of Toronto, Montr\'eal and Vancouver; other CMAs; average-size cities, referred to as census agglomerations (CAs); small towns and rural communities; and five regions of Canada, namely Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, the Prairies and British Columbia. Material and social deprivation and their links to mortality vary considerably by geographic area. We comment on the results as well as the limitations of the index and its advantages for health planning.}

  abstract = {Objectives: To overcome the absence of socio-economic information in administrative databases and to monitor social inequalities in health, a material and social deprivation index was developed for Qu\'ebec and Canada. Methods: The index is based on the smallest area unit used in Canadian censuses, with 400 to 700 persons on average. It includes six socio-economic indicators grouped along two dimensions - material and social - produced from principal component analyses. The index exists for 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2006 and in different versions, from local areas to the whole of Canada. Numerous products related to the index are available online free of charge. Results: The index has been used extensively in the field of health and social services, mainly in the province of Qu\'ebec but also elsewhere in Canada. It has had four main uses, all related to public health: describing geographic variations of deprivation, illustrating inequalities in population health status and in service use according to deprivation, supporting the development of health reports and policies, and guiding regional resource allocation. These applications are facilitated by a close partnership between the producers and users of the index. Conclusion: The deprivation index is a marker of social inequalities in health. It allows for monitoring of inequalities over time and space, and constitutes a useful tool for public health planning, intervention and service delivery.},

The representation of both the ground surface and the features on that surface necessitates the removal of these surface features if a ground surface Digital Elevation Model (DEM) product is to be produced. This paper examines methods for extracting surface features from a Digital Surface Model (DSM) produced by LiDAR. It is argued that for some applications the extracted surface feature layer can be of almost equal importance to the DEM. The example of flood inundation modelling is used to illustrate how a DEM and a surface roughness layer could be extracted from the original DSM. The potential for refining surface roughness estimates by classifying extracted surface features using both topographic and spectral characteristics is considered using an Artificial Neural Network to discriminate between buildings and trees.},

The analysis focuses on the impacts of a diverse set of innovative drivers of urban value creation and sustainable solutions for city development (urban functions), which are collectively subsumed under the heading of `sustainable smart city'. Recognizing that the dynamics and growth processes related to these urban functions may have different impacts on different types of stakeholders, potentially leading to the emergence of serious conflicts between guests/visitors and residents, we aim to derive model-based implications for urban and tourism management in the cities concerned in order to move towards the sustainable future city as `a place 4 all'. The results of our latent growth curve model confirm the existence of different impacts of urban functions on visitors' and residents' attractiveness. Cultural dynamics appears to be a major determinant for attracting new residents and supporting a strong international tourism industry. From an economic perspective, purely economic strength (in terms of absolute growth) appears to enhance city attractiveness for residents, while the dynamics observed in research and development activities influences the quality of employment instead of being a direct driver of population growth. While the social aspects of sustainability (framed under the concept of livability) and the urban environment typically exert higher impacts on urban attractiveness, accessibility appears mostly relevant for visitors. Our analysis suggests an uneasy balance between livability, environment, and population and visitor volume and growth.},

Methods: NZDep has been created from four 5-yearly censuses using theory developed from international deprivation research, a standard statistical procedure (principal component analysis) and both construct and criterion validation. Results: The latest index was based on nine socio-economic deprivation variables available for just over 4 million people. It was calculated from a basis of 24,000 small areas containing a median of approximately 90 people. The deprivation index has a value from 1 (low) to 10 (high). It is mapped to standard administrative areas and is available free of charge. The index is easy to visualize, and deprivation maps are widely used. The index is used in many applications in research and social epidemiology, and routinely by the country's Ministry of Health, both to explore health variations across the country and to allocate central government funds to local health care providers. Geographers in local government were quick to recognize the index as a good tool for visualizing the diversity and neediness of local communities, and hence as a tool for town and service planning. Conclusion: The national NZDep index of small-area deprivation has been used widely in research on mortality, morbidity and determinants of ill health, and in needs assessment, resource allocation and advocacy.},

I advocate for the strengths of thinking geographically, a way of being in the world open to all. This means attending to the geography of knowledge production; how spatiotemporalities shape and are shaped by socionatural processes; the emergent more-than-human world; the variety of ontologies, epistemologies, and methodologies underlying knowledge claims; and the world not only as it is but also as it should be. Thinking geographically about globalizing capitalism can problematize the particular sociospatial positionalities from which commonsense understandings of capitalism have metastasized. Europe did not invent capitalist practices but became globalizing capitalism's center of calculation, catalyzed by the spatial dynamics of colonialism elevating Europe relative to its predecessors. Thinking geographically undermines the mainstream account of globalizing capitalism emanating from Europe, that of a rising tide capable of lifting all boats and bringing prosperity to all hard-working and responsible individuals and well-governed territories. Indeed, such body- and place-based accounts obscure how asymmetric connectivities between places and interscalar dynamics, coevolving with uneven geographical development, coproduce unequal sociospatial positionality and conditions of possibility for those propagating and encountering globalizing capitalism. Capitalism also cannot be understood, or practiced, simply as an economic process; its economic aspects are co-implicated with political, cultural (gendered, raced, etc.), social, and biophysical processes, in ways that repeatedly exceed and undermine any ``laws of economics.'' Thinking geographically necessitates acknowledging space for alternative, more-than-capitalist experiments and trajectories, enriched by peripheral experiences of and encounters with globalizing capitalism.},

Protecting YRB is crucial to China's rejuvenation and sustainable development of future generations. Coordinated development of human-land system is conducive to promoting ecological protection and high-quality development of YRB. Tapio decoupling model was used to study the relationship between rural residential land area and resident population. Our results showed that the rural resident population decreased by 2.57\% annually, while rural residential land areas expanded at a rate of 0.57\% from 2010 to 2016. In addition, the upper reaches had higher growth rate of residential land area than that in the middle and lower reaches. The strong negative decoupling relationship between rural residential land area and rural resident population was widely found in YRB. Kaya identity decomposition results indicated that rural residential land intensive utilization and urbanization of resident population was positively related to the expansion of rural residential land area, while the urban and rural population structure was responsible for rural residential land area shrinkage in YRB. Unfavorable rural development situation had extended from 2010 to 2016. These results suggested that the rural human-land relationship was uncoordinated in terms of the loss of rural resident population and expansion of rural residential land area in YRB. It is urgent to establish sustainable rural development strategies for improving the human-land relationship, narrowing the rural-urban disparity, innovating rural residential land area policies, and revitalizing the rural area.},

The approach used is both intuitively appealing and fully consistent with basic urban location theory developed over the past decade. Multidimensional price gradients are estimated for such amenities as low crime, clean air, accessibility to work, the local quality of education and local taxes. In addition subgroup analysis allows the comparison of the estimated ``shadow prices'' for two different income groups.},

Currently, it is difficult to track social, economic, environmental and health outcomes in cities with high spatial and temporal resolution, needed to evaluate policies regarding urban inequalities. We applied a deep learning approach to street~images for measuring spatial distributions of income, education, unemployment, housing, living environment, health and crime. Our model predicts different outcomes directly from raw images without extracting intermediate user-defined features. To evaluate the performance of the approach, we first trained neural networks on a subset of images from London using ground truth data at high spatial resolution from official statistics. We then compared how trained networks separated the best-off from worst-off deciles for different outcomes in images not used in training. The best performance was achieved for quality of the living environment and mean income. Allocation was least successful for crime and self-reported health (but not objectively measured health). We also evaluated how networks trained in London predict outcomes three other major cities in the UK: Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds. The transferability analysis showed that networks trained in London, fine-tuned with only 1\% of images in other cities, achieved performances similar to ones from trained on data from target cities themselves. Our findings demonstrate that street~imagery has the potential complement traditional survey-based and administrative data sources for high-resolution urban surveillance to measure inequalities and monitor the impacts of policies that aim to address them.},

  abstract = {Promoting the coordinated development of population health and the economy is an important part of building a ``Healthy China'' and promoting high-quality economic development. Based on the systematic construction of the population health and economic development evaluation index system, this paper uses the coupled coordination model, geodetector, and geographically weighted regression (GWR) to comprehensively measure the population health level and economic development level at the provincial scale in China in 2000 and 2015, and reveals the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of the coupled coordination relationship between the population health level and economic development level at the provincial scale in China from 2000 to 2015 and its driving factors. The results show the following: (1) China's population health and economic development are in a high-level coupling stage, and the coupling level increases slightly with time; spatially, two types of running-in coupling and high-level coupling coexist; the coupling degree in the eastern and central regions tends to increase, while the coupling degree in the western region tends to weaken. (2) China's population health and economic development are in a good coupling coordination stage as a whole, and the coupling coordination degree has an increasing trend; spatially, the coupling coordination degree shows high spatial differentiation characteristics in the east and low in the west; the good and high-quality coupling coordination type area tends to expand to the west, while the moderate coupling coordination type area tends to shrink to the west; there is also positive spatial agglomeration of coupling coordination degree, and the spatial agglomeration is gradually enhanced. (3) The coupling coordination of China's population health and economic development is driven by multiple factors such as natural conditions, health resources, culture quality, and urbanization level; the interaction between factors is stronger than that of a single factor, and the driving effect of each factor also shows significant spatial heterogeneity. This study is intended to provide a scientific basis for promoting harmonious population health and economic development.},

We then qualitatively compared the indices based on the input-variable domains, data sources, index creation characteristics, index accessibility, the geography over which the index is applied, and the nature of the output measure or measures. We identified fifteen commonly used indices of area-level socioeconomic deprivation. There were notable differences in the characteristics of each index, particularly in how they define socioeconomic deprivation based on input-variable domains, the geography over which they are applied, and their output measures. These characteristics can help guide future index selection and application in clinical care, research, and policy decisions.}

  abstract = {Inundation disasters, caused by sudden water level rise or rapid flow, occur frequently in various parts of the world. Such catastrophes strike not only in thinly populated flood plains or farmland but also in highly populated villages or urban areas. Inundation of the populated areas causes severe damage to the economy, injury, and loss of life; therefore, a proper management scheme for the disaster has to be developed. To predict and manage such adversity, an understanding of the dynamic processes of inundation flow is necessary because risk estimation is performed based on inundation flow information. In this study, we developed a comprehensive method to conduct detailed inundation flow simulations for a populated area with quite complex topographical features using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. Detailed geospatial information including the location and shape of each building was extracted from the LiDAR data and used for the grid generation. The developed approach can distinguish buildings from vegetation and treat them differently in the flow model. With this method, a fine unstructured grid can be generated representing the complicated urban land features precisely without exhausting labour for data preparation. The accuracy of the generated grid with different grid spacing and grid type is discussed and the optimal range of grid spacing for direct representation of urban topography is investigated. The developed method is applied to the estimation of inundation flows, which occurred in the basin of the Shin-minato River. A detailed inundation flow structure is represented by the flow model, and the flow characteristics with respect to topographic features are discussed.

  abstract = {Research ethics are not the favourite subject of most undergraduate geography students. However, in the light of increasing mixedmethods research, as well as research using geocodes, it is necessary to train students in the field of ethics. Experiential learning is an approach to teaching that is potentially suitable for teaching ethics. The aim of this article is to discuss how the experiential learning process in a course on Ethics \& GPS-tracking contributed to the ethical awareness of third-year undergraduate geography students. We conducted a qualitative study in which we held four focus group discussions with two cohorts of students (2016 and 2017). We explored the students' views on the learning environment in relation to ethics in GPS-based and mixed-methods research. Our findings show how an informal learning environment and collaborative learning in a small group contributed to deep understanding of research ethics. These aspects of the learning environment are tied to an ethical framework that consists of three dimensions: (1) the ethics of collaborative research between staff and students; (2) the ethics of privacy raised by the geo-technology adopted in this research case study; and (3) the ethics of the research process with respect to informed consent and data storage.},

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the progress in remote sensing of soil moisture, with focus on technique approaches for soil moisture estimation from optical, thermal, passive microwave, and active microwave measurements. The physical principles and the status of current retrieval methods are summarized.

Traditional approaches have used demographics and geographical influences to estimate crime rates in a region. With the fast development of positioning technology and prevalence of mobile devices, a large amount of modern urban data have been collected and such big data can provide new perspectives for understanding crime. In this paper, we used large-scale Point-Of-Interest data and taxi flow data in the city of Chicago, IL in the USA. We observed significantly improved performance in crime rate inference compared to using traditional features. Such an improvement is consistent over multiple years. We also show that these new features are significant in the feature importance analysis.},

  abstract = {Developing a comprehensive understanding of inter-city interactions is crucial for regional planning. We therefore examined spatiotemporal patterns of population migration across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) using migration big data from Tencent for the period between 2015 and 2019. We initially used decomposition and breakpoint detection methods to examine time-series migration data and to identify the two seasons with the strongest and weakest population migration levels, between June 18th and August 18th and between October 8th and February 15th, respectively. Population migration within the former period was 2.03 times that seen in the latter. We then used a variety of network analysis methods to examine population flow directions as well as the importance of each individual city in migration. The two capital cities on the QTP, Lhasa and Xining, form centers for population migration and are also transfer hubs through which migrants from other cities off the plateau enter and leave this region. Data show that these two cities contribute more than 35\% of total population migration. The majority of migrants tend to move within the province, particularly during the weakest migration season. We also utilized interactive relationship force and radiation models to examine the interaction strength and the radiating energy of each individual city. Results show that Lhasa and Xining exhibit the strongest interactions with other cities and have the largest radiating energies. Indeed, the radiating energy of the QTP cities correlates with their gross domestic product (GDP) (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.754 in the weakest migration season, WMS versus 0.737 in the strongest migration season, SMS), while changes in radiating energy correlate with the tourism-related revenue (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.685). These outcomes suggest that level of economic development and level of tourism are the two most important factors driving the QTP population migration. The results of this analysis provide critical clarification guidance regarding huge QTP development differences.},

A retrospective study examined one year of hospital admissions for asthma in the West Midlands region of England (n = 10,044), and in one of the region's wealthier districts, Worcester (n = 251). Age standardized admission ratios (SARs) for asthma, and the routes of hospital admission, were compared with the Towns- end Deprivation Index for the place of residence. Asthma SAR was strongly associated with deprivation as measured by the Towns end Index for the district of residence (Spearman rank correlation coefficient rho = 0.65; p = 0.004). Asthma admission rates for all age groups, except those aged over 65 yrs, were higher in poorer districts. A significantly greater proportion of emergency admissions in poorer districts came via Accident and Emergency departments, rather than general practitioner referrals (rho = 0.76; p {$<$} 0.001). Within Worcester District, SAR was associated with Townsend Index for the ward of residence (rho = 0.39; p {$<$} 0.001). This remained significant after excluding repeat admissions (rho = 0.45; p {$<$} 0.001). We conclude that asthma admissions are strongly associated with deprivation in the community. Differences in the health care received during acute exacerbations by asthma patients from different economic backgrounds is likely to be an important factor in this relationship.},

They have shifted their emphasis from compromised use values (embodied in the paternalistic notion of ``blight'') to diminished exchange values (embodied in the notion of ``obsolescence'').

In the past thirty years, as one of spatial data sources, remote sensing datasets, which contain more information of earth surface as compared with usual urban maps, have been used in urban planning and management in China. With the development of remote sensing technology such as the high spatial resolution sensors, 3D laser scanning, data mining and advanced image processing technology, remote sensing can be widely used in the whole range of urban planning processes. In this paper, we firstly make a review of the urban remote sensing applications in urban study and planning by giving examples. Then we identify remote sensing applications in different urban planning stages including master planning, district planning, detailed planning and planning implementation as well as in urban studies. We also analyze the bottlenecks of the remote sensing applications in urban planning and management in China at the end.},

  abstract = {This study analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution and driving factors of the floating school-age population in Liaoning Province, China from 2008 to 2020 using county-level statistical education data combined with spatial autocorrelation and the multiscale geographically weighted regression model. The major findings are as follows. From 2008 to 2020, the distribution of the school-age migrant population exhibited obvious spatial imbalance characteristics both in terms of the number and proportion of school-age migrants. Specifically, the school-age migrant population was concentrated in the municipal districts of large and medium-sized cities and continued to increase over time in the suburbs of large and medium-sized cities. Over the past 12 years, the distribution of the school-age migrant population in Liaoning Province exhibited significant spatial autocorrelation. From the number of school-age migrants, the cold and hot spot area expanded. Conversely, from the proportion of school-age migrants, the cold and hot spot area decreased gradually, whereas the cold spot area became more diffuse. Regarding the driving factors, the quantity and quality of teaching staff, the quality of teaching equipment and conditions, and the quality of the education environment played a role in promoting or restraining the differentiation of the school-age migrant population in Liaoning Province. Moreover, the degree of influence of the driving factors exhibited substantial spatial differences.},

This paper addresses this gap and employs a novel, open and reproducible urban analytics approach to systematically examine the past and future trajectories of neighbourhood change using London, England, as a case-study example. Using suites of datasets relating to population, house prices, and built environment development, the nature of gentrification's mutations and its spatial patterns are extracted through a multi-stage data dimensionality reduction and classification methodology. Machine learning is subsequently adopted to model gentrification's observed trends and predict its future frontiers with interactive visualisation methods offering new insights into gentrification's projected dynamics and geographies.},

Our modeling approach is based on the use of airborne LiDAR which offers a fast and effective way to acquire models for a large urban environment. To verify and refine the reconstructed ragged model, we present a primitive-based model refinement approach that requires minor user assistance. Given the limited user input, the system automatically segments the building boundary, does the model refinement, and assembles the complete building model. By adapting a set of appropriate geometric primitives and fitting strategies, the system can model a range of complex buildings with irregular shapes. We demonstrate this system's ability to model a variety of complex buildings rapidly and accurately from LiDAR data of the entire USC campus.},

This paper demonstrates that Building Coverage Ratio (BCR), Floor Area Ratio (FAR), and other building density indicators can be numerically and automatically derived from high-resolution airborne LiDAR data. An object-based method is proposed to process the LiDAR data for the building density information. The method consists of a sequence of numerical operations: generating the normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM), extracting building objects, deriving object attributes, associating objects with the corresponding land lots, and computing building density indicators at land lot and urban district scales. The algorithms for these operations have been implemented as an ArcGIS extension module. The object-based method is applied to the processing of airborne LiDAR data over downtown Houston. Various attributes have been derived to quantify the building density, urban physical structure, and landscape morphological characteristics of the downtown area at three different spatial scales.},

There is an apparent correlation between LST and NDVI from the visual interpretation of LST and NDVI contrasts. Mean LST and NDVI values associated with different land-use types are significantly different. Multiple comparisons of mean LST and NDVI values associated with pairings of each land-use type are also shown to be significantly different. The result of a regressive analysis shows an inverse correlation relationship between LST and NDVI within all land-use polygons, the same to each land-use type, but correlation coefficients associated with land-use types are different. An analysis on the relationship between LST, NDVI and Shannon Diversity Index (SHDI) shows a positive correlation between LST and SHDI and a negative correlation between NDVI and SHDI. According to the above results, LST, SHDI and NDVI can be considered to be three basic indices to study the urban ecological environment and to contribute to further validation of the applicability of relatively low cost, moderate spatial resolution satellite imagery in evaluating environmental impacts of urban land function zoning, then to examine the impact of urban land-use on the urban environment in Shanghai City. This provides an effective tool in evaluating the environmental influences of zoning in urban ecosystems with remote sensing and geographical information systems.},

  abstract = {The surface urban heat island (SUHI), which represents the difference of land surface temperature (LST) in urban relativity to neighboring non-urban surfaces, is usually measured using satellite LST data. Over the last few decades, advancements of remote sensing along with spatial science have considerably increased the number and quality of SUHI studies that form the major body of the urban heat island (UHI) literature. This paper provides a systematic review of satellite-based SUHI studies, from their origin in 1972 to the present. We find an exponentially increasing trend of SUHI research since 2005, with clear preferences for geographic areas, time of day, seasons, research foci, and platforms/sensors. The most frequently studied region and time period of research are China and summer daytime, respectively. Nearly two-thirds of the studies focus on the SUHI/LST variability at a local scale. The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are the two most commonly-used satellite sensors and account for about 78\% of the total publications. We systematically reviewed the main satellite/sensors, methods, key findings, and challenges of the SUHI research. Previous studies confirm that the large spatial (local to global scales) and temporal (diurnal, seasonal, and inter-annual) variations of SUHI are contributed by a variety of factors such as impervious surface area, vegetation cover, landscape structure, albedo, and climate. However, applications of SUHI research are largely impeded by a series of data and methodological limitations. Lastly, we propose key potential directions and opportunities for future efforts. Besides improving the quality and quantity of LST data, more attention should be focused on understudied regions/cities, methods to examine SUHI intensity, inter-annual variability and long-term trends of SUHI, scaling issues of SUHI, the relationship between surface and subsurface UHIs, and the integration of remote sensing with field observations and numeric modeling.},
